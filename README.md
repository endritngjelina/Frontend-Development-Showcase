# Frontend Development Showcase

A small collection of standalone frontend demos built as an iteration-style showcase. Each numbered HTML file is a self-contained page you can open in your browser.

## What’s inside

- `Frontend Development Showcase 1.html`, `2.html`, `3.html`: Individual demo pages / iterations.
- `README.md`: Project notes and usage.
- `LICENSE`: MIT.

## Run locally

No tooling required.

1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Open any `Frontend Development Showcase *.html` file in a web browser.
3. Compare versions to see different layout/styling/interaction experiments.

## Goals

This repo is meant to:
- Showcase frontend fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS as needed)
- Provide quick, shareable demos without a build step
- Support rapid iteration by keeping pages separate and easy to test

## Contributing / extending

Suggestions and PRs are welcome:
- Add a new numbered HTML file for a new demo or revision.
- Keep demos self-contained where possible.
- If you add shared assets (CSS/JS/images), place them in an `/assets` folder and update this README.
